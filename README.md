## ðŸ“Š Features & Methodology

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Normalization of open-text responses using string cleaning, mapping, and NLP (sentence embeddings + clustering).
  - Encoding of categorical variables.
  - Handling of missing or ambiguous responses.

- **Clustering**
  - Used `KMeans` clustering to group respondents into two categories: likely to have mental health conditions or not.
  - All features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

- **Visualization**
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis) used for 2D visualization of clusters.
  - Plots generated using `matplotlib`.
